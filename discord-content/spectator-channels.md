## 【📜】rules

### Post 1: Community Rules

# Dojo Rules 📜

The dojo runs on respect and discipline. Follow these rules or get swept.

### 1. No Financial Advice
Everything here is **education only**. We share ideas, not recommendations. Your trades are YOUR responsibility.

### 2. No Spam or Self-Promo
Don't plug your Discord, course, signals, or affiliate links. Instant ban.

### 3. Respect Everyone
- No harassment, racism, sexism, or personal attacks
- Disagreements are fine. Being a jerk isn't.
- Help beginners instead of mocking them

### 4. No Pump & Dumps
Don't shill random tickers. If you share a trade idea, explain your reasoning.

### 5. Keep It Legal
- No sharing paid content from other services
- No market manipulation schemes
- Nothing illegal. Period.

### 6. Use the Right Channels
- Trade ideas → appropriate channel
- Off-topic stuff → #off-topic
- Questions → #ask-questions-here

### 7. No Begging
Don't DM members asking for money, signals, or free mentorship.

### 8. Protect Your Capital
We're here to learn, not gamble. If someone's telling you to YOLO your account, that's not the Dojo way.

**Break the rules = Warning → Timeout → Ban**

The Sensei's word is final.

Now go train. 🥋

# 💬 General Chat

This is the main hangout. Talk trading, share wins, ask questions, whatever.

**Vibe check:**
- Keep it friendly
- Help each other out
- No spam or promos

## 【🎯】level-up

### Post 1: About Leveling

# 🎯 Level Up!

This channel celebrates member milestones.

When you hit a new level from being active in the community, it'll show up here.

**How leveling works:**
- Chat in channels = XP
- More XP = Higher level
- Higher level = Flex on the newcomers 😤

This isn't pay-to-win. Put in the work, engage with the community, and watch your rank grow.

Keep grinding. 🥋

## 【❓】ask-questions-here

### Post 1: Pinned Question Guide

# ❓ Ask Questions Here

No dumb questions. Only dumb traders who were too proud to ask.

**How to ask a good question:**
1. Be specific (not just "how do I trade?")
2. Show what you've already tried
3. Include screenshots if relevant
4. Tag your experience level

**Example of a GOOD question:**
> "I'm a beginner learning support/resistance. On this SPY chart, I drew these levels [screenshot]. Am I identifying them correctly? The $480 level keeps getting tested."

**Example of a BAD question:**
> "How do I make money trading?"

---

Community members and mods will jump in to help.

Be patient. Be grateful. Pay it forward when you level up.

The Dojo helps those who help themselves. 🥋
