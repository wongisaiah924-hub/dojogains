# Module 1: Foundation

## 1.1 What is Price Action?

Price action is the movement of price over time. Instead of using indicators, we read the **raw price** on the chart to understand what buyers and sellers are doing.

**Key Concept:** Every candle tells a story of the battle between buyers and sellers.

### Candlestick Basics

```
      ─── Wick (High)
      │
    ┌─┴─┐
    │   │ ← Body (Open to Close)
    └─┬─┘
      │
      ─── Wick (Low)
```

**Bullish Candle (Green):** Close > Open = Buyers won
**Bearish Candle (Red):** Close < Open = Sellers won

### What Wicks Tell Us

- **Long upper wick:** Sellers rejected higher prices
- **Long lower wick:** Buyers rejected lower prices
- **No wick:** Strong conviction in that direction

---

## 1.2 What is Market Structure?

Market structure is the **pattern of highs and lows** that price creates. It tells us who is in control — buyers or sellers.

### Uptrend Structure

```
          HH (Higher High)
         /
        /
      HL (Higher Low)
     /
    /
   HH
  /
HL
```

**Uptrend = Higher Highs + Higher Lows**
- Buyers are in control
- Look for LONG opportunities

### Downtrend Structure

```
LH (Lower High)
 \
  \
   LL (Lower Low)
    \
     \
      LH
       \
        LL
```

**Downtrend = Lower Highs + Lower Lows**
- Sellers are in control
- Look for SHORT opportunities

### Ranging Structure

```
─── Resistance ───
        
   (price bounces between)
        
─── Support ───────
```

**Range = Equal highs and equal lows**
- No clear winner
- Wait for breakout or trade the range

---

## 1.3 Swing Points

A **swing high** is a peak where price reversed down.
A **swing low** is a trough where price reversed up.

### Identifying Swing Points

**Swing High:** A candle with lower highs on BOTH sides
```
    X ← Swing High
   / \
  /   \
```

**Swing Low:** A candle with higher lows on BOTH sides
```
  \   /
   \ /
    X ← Swing Low
```

### Why Swing Points Matter

1. They define market structure (HH, HL, LH, LL)
2. Liquidity sits above swing highs and below swing lows
3. Break of a swing point = Break of Structure (BOS)

---

# Module 2: Liquidity

## 2.1 What is Liquidity?

**Liquidity = Stop losses clustered at a price level**

When you place a trade, your stop loss becomes "liquidity" for bigger players. Institutions need liquidity to fill their large orders.

### The Game

- Retail traders place stops at obvious levels
- Institutions push price INTO those stops
- Stops get triggered = orders filled
- Price reverses

**You want to trade WITH institutions, not against them.**

---

## 2.2 Where Does Liquidity Sit?

### Above Swing Highs

```
─── Swing High ───
    [STOPS HERE] ← Shorts have stops here
         │
         ▼
    (price below)
```

### Below Swing Lows

```
    (price above)
         │
         ▼
    [STOPS HERE] ← Longs have stops here
─── Swing Low ────
```

### Equal Highs / Equal Lows

The MOST obvious liquidity. Everyone sees it.

```
═══ Equal Highs ═══ ← Maximum stops clustered here
    │       │
```

```
    │       │
═══ Equal Lows ════ ← Maximum stops clustered here
```

### Other Liquidity Zones

| Level | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Previous Day High (PDH) | Obvious level, many stops |
| Previous Day Low (PDL) | Obvious level, many stops |
| Session Highs/Lows | Intraday traders' stops |
| Round Numbers (25000, 25500) | Psychological levels |
| Trendlines | Traders place stops beyond |

---

## 2.3 Liquidity Sweep (The Trap)

A **liquidity sweep** is when price spikes through a level to grab stops, then reverses.

### How to Spot It

```
                    Liquidity Grab
                         │
═══ Equal Highs ═══     ▼
         │         ┌──X──┐ ← Wick above
         │         │     │
                   └─────┘
                      │
                      ▼
              (Price reverses)
```

### Characteristics

- Quick spike through the level
- Long wick / rejection
- Reversal follows
- Often happens at session open or news

### The Play

**Don't chase the breakout. Wait for the sweep, then trade the reversal.**

---

# Module 3: Break of Structure (BOS)

## 3.1 What is BOS?

**Break of Structure (BOS)** = Price breaks a swing point, confirming direction.

### Bullish BOS

Price breaks ABOVE a swing high = Buyers confirmed in control

```
         ┌───────── Bullish BOS
         │
    SH ──┼── (Swing High broken)
   /     │
  /      ▼
 SL    (Now look for longs)
```

### Bearish BOS

Price breaks BELOW a swing low = Sellers confirmed in control

```
 SH    (Now look for shorts)
  \      ▲
   \     │
    SL ──┼── (Swing Low broken)
         │
         └───────── Bearish BOS
```

---

## 3.2 Change of Character (CHoCH)

**CHoCH** = The FIRST break of structure against the current trend.

It signals a potential trend reversal.

### Example: Uptrend Reversing

```
      HH
     /  \
   HL    \
  /       \
HH         \
            X ← Breaks below HL (CHoCH!)
           /
          /
        LL ← Now bearish
```

### CHoCH vs BOS

| | CHoCH | BOS |
|---|-------|-----|
| What | First break against trend | Continuation of trend |
| Meaning | Potential reversal | Trend continues |
| When | Trend change | Trend confirmation |

### Trading Rule

1. Wait for **CHoCH** to signal reversal
2. Then trade **BOS** in the new direction

---

## 3.3 BOS Trading Rules

### ✅ DO

- Wait for candle CLOSE beyond the level
- Look for BOS in direction of HTF bias
- Enter on pullback after BOS

### ❌ DON'T

- Trade before BOS (that's guessing)
- Chase immediately after BOS
- Fight the HTF trend

---

# Module 4: Imbalances (Fair Value Gaps)

## 4.1 What is a Fair Value Gap (FVG)?

An **FVG** is a gap in price where there was no trading — pure imbalance between buyers and sellers.

Price tends to return to "fill" these gaps.

### How to Identify

Look for 3 candles where the wicks don't overlap:

```
Bullish FVG:

    │
  ┌─┴─┐
  │ 3 │
  └─┬─┘
    │
           ← GAP (FVG)
    │
  ┌─┴─┐
  │ 1 │
  └───┘
```

The gap between Candle 1's high and Candle 3's low = FVG

### Bearish FVG

```
  ┌───┐
  │ 1 │
  └─┬─┘
    │
           ← GAP (FVG)
    │
  ┌─┴─┐
  │ 3 │
  └─┬─┘
    │
```

---

## 4.2 Trading FVGs

### The Play

1. Identify FVG on HTF (1H, 4H, Daily)
2. Wait for price to return to the FVG
3. Enter when price taps the FVG
4. Stop loss: Beyond the FVG
5. Target: Next liquidity pool

### FVG as Entry Zone

```
          │
        ┌─┴─┐
        │   │
        └───┘
          │
   ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ← FVG Zone (Entry)
          │
        ┌─┴─┐
        │   │ ← Price returns here
        └───┘
          │
          ▼
    (Continuation)
```

---

## 4.3 Confluence with FVGs

FVG alone is not enough. Stack confluences:

**Strong FVG Setup:**
- FVG ✓
- In discount/premium zone ✓
- After liquidity sweep ✓
- With BOS ✓

**Weak FVG Setup:**
- FVG ✓
- No other confluence ✗

---

# Module 5: Premium & Discount

## 5.1 The Concept

Institutions buy low, sell high. Simple.

- **Discount** = Below 50% of range = BUY zone
- **Premium** = Above 50% of range = SELL zone

### Visualized

```
─── Swing High ───  ← PREMIUM (Sell Zone)
         │              • Look for shorts
         │              • Price is "expensive"
   - - 50% EQ - -   ← Equilibrium
         │              
         │              • Price is "cheap"
─── Swing Low ────  ← DISCOUNT (Buy Zone)
                        • Look for longs
```

---

## 5.2 How to Use It

### For Longs

1. Wait for price to enter DISCOUNT (below 50%)
2. Look for bullish BOS
3. Enter on FVG or order block
4. Target: Premium zone or liquidity above

### For Shorts

1. Wait for price to enter PREMIUM (above 50%)
2. Look for bearish BOS
3. Enter on FVG or order block
4. Target: Discount zone or liquidity below

### The Rule

> "Buy in discount, sell in premium"
> 
> Don't buy at highs. Don't sell at lows.

# Module 6: Time

## 6.1 Killzones

Not all hours are equal. Institutions are most active during specific windows.

### Key Sessions (ET)

| Session | Time (ET) | Character |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Asia | 8 PM - 12 AM | Consolidation, builds liquidity |
| London | 3 AM - 6 AM | First major moves, sweeps Asia |
| NY Open | 9:30 AM - 11 AM | Highest volume, real moves |
| NY Lunch | 12 PM - 2 PM | Chop, avoid trading |
| NY Close | 2 PM - 4 PM | Second chance, continuation |

### Best Times to Trade

**Primary:** 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM ET (NY Open)
**Secondary:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM ET (NY Afternoon)

### Times to Avoid

- 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM ET (Lunch chop)
- Major news events (unless you trade news)
- Low volume pre-market

---

## 6.2 Session Liquidity

Each session builds liquidity for the next.

### The Pattern

```
Asia builds range → London sweeps one side → NY continues or reverses
```

**Common Scenario:**
1. Asia creates equal highs/lows
2. London sweeps the lows (grabs liquidity)
3. NY rallies (real move)

### Using This

Before NY Open, ask:
- What did Asia build? (Range? Trend?)
- What did London sweep? (Highs? Lows?)
- Where is liquidity now?

---

# Module 7: HTF Bias

## 7.1 Why HTF Bias Matters

Your **Higher Timeframe (HTF) bias** is your compass. It tells you which direction to trade.

**Rule:** Only take LTF trades that align with HTF bias.

---

## 7.2 Determining HTF Bias

### Step 1: Check Daily/4H Structure

- Higher Highs + Higher Lows = **Bullish**
- Lower Highs + Lower Lows = **Bearish**

### Step 2: Premium or Discount?

- Price in premium (above 50%) = Look for sells
- Price in discount (below 50%) = Look for buys

### Step 3: Where is Liquidity?

- Untaken highs above = Bullish target
- Untaken lows below = Bearish target

### Step 4: Session Context

- London swept lows = NY likely bullish
- London swept highs = NY likely bearish

---

## 7.3 HTF Bias Checklist

Before every trade:

| Question | Bullish | Bearish |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Daily structure? | HH/HL | LH/LL |
| Premium or discount? | Discount | Premium |
| Nearest liquidity? | Highs above | Lows below |
| Session sweep? | Lows taken | Highs taken |

**3-4 align = Strong bias = Trade with confidence**
**Mixed = No trade or reduced size**

---

# Module 8: Entry Model

## 8.1 The Confluence Stack

**Minimum 3 confluences before entry:**

1. ✅ HTF Bias (Daily/4H direction)
2. ✅ Liquidity Sweep (Stops grabbed)
3. ✅ BOS on LTF (Structure confirmed)
4. ✅ FVG/OB Entry (Defined risk)
5. ✅ Time (In killzone)

**More confluence = Higher probability**

---

## 8.2 Entry Checklist

```
□ HTF bias determined (bullish/bearish)
□ Price in discount (for longs) or premium (for shorts)
□ Liquidity swept
□ LTF BOS confirms direction
□ Entry at FVG/OB
□ Stop loss placed (beyond structure)
□ Target identified (next liquidity)
□ Risk defined (1-2% max)
```

---

## 8.3 Example Long Setup

1. **Daily:** Making higher lows (bullish)
2. **4H:** Price in discount
3. **1H:** Swept lows, then bullish BOS
4. **Entry:** Pullback to 1H FVG
5. **Stop:** Below the swept low
6. **Target:** Previous high (liquidity)

---

# Module 9: Risk Management

## 9.1 The Only Edge That Matters

You can have the best strategy, but without risk management, you WILL blow up.

### Core Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Risk 1-2% per trade | Survive losing streaks |
| Max 2 trades per day | Prevent overtrading |
| Stop after 2 losses | Protect your psychology |
| Always use stop loss | Define your risk |

---

## 9.2 Position Sizing

**Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / Stop Loss Distance
```

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 1% ($100)
- Stop: 20 points on NQ
- NQ tick value: $2/point

Position = $100 / (20 × $2) = 2.5 contracts → Round to 2

---

## 9.3 Risk:Reward

**Minimum R:R = 1:2**

If you risk $100, target $200 minimum.

| Win Rate | Needed R:R to Profit |
|----------|---------------------|
| 50% | 1:1 (breakeven) |
| 40% | 1:1.5 |
| 33% | 1:2 |

**Better R:R = More room for error**

---

# Module 10: Psychology

## 10.1 The Mental Game

Trading is 80% psychology, 20% strategy.

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Revenge trading | Walk away after 2 losses |
| FOMO entries | Only trade your setup |
| Moving stop loss | Set it and forget it |
| Overtrading | Quality over quantity |
| No journal | Review every trade |

---

## 10.2 The Mindset

**Process > Outcome**

A losing trade can be a good trade (if you followed your rules).
A winning trade can be a bad trade (if you broke your rules).

**Focus on execution, not results.**

---

## 10.3 Daily Routine

### Pre-Market (30 min before open)
1. Check Daily/4H structure
2. Identify key levels (liquidity, FVGs)
3. Determine HTF bias
4. Note any news events

### During Session
1. Wait for setup (don't force)
2. Execute with discipline
3. Manage trade (trail stop if needed)
4. Stop after daily goal or 2 losses

### Post-Market (15 min)
1. Screenshot trades
2. Journal: What worked? What didn't?
3. Review emotions: Were you disciplined?
